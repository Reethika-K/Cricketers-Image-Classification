This project is a machine learning web application that classifies popular cricketers based on their facial and eye recognition.
<br>
It uses a trained ML model to accurately identify cricketers from uploaded images. For best results, users are advised to upload clear and high-quality images showing the full face.
<br>
Training Data: Images were collected from Google and manually curated to build the dataset.
<br>
Model Training: Performed using Google Colab for efficient and faster processing.
<br>
Backend: A lightweight Flask server handles incoming image classification requests.
<br>
Frontend: Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to easily drag and drop images for prediction.
<br>
The system uses OpenCV for detecting faces and eyes to ensure proper image cropping before classification.
<br>
The project aims to deliver an interactive and user-friendly experience for real-time cricketer identification!
